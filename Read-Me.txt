***Project completed in visual studio 2010

----------------------------------------IMPORTANT------------------------------------------
**This is the final version of my project. I already submitted one on the 28th April, approx. time 11:40
**I didn't have a feature of encrypting the data in the last project I submited BUT IN THIS ONE I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
IMPLEMENTED THE ENCRYPTION TOO. USING  XOR ALGORITHMS.


FEATURES:
1)Insert the contact(list Node) initially by finding the correct position in the list. 
eg. If you want to insert "D" in the list of A B E , it will find the correct position and insert the node. -> A B C D
2:User also have an option of viewing the contact by the first name -> This has been sorted recursively using bubble sort algorithms
3: Encrypt/Decrypt the CSV file.

Please be sure not to open the CSV file's while you are performig some action with that specific file otherwise it might throw the exception if the file
is in used by another program. This is not the application bug but the fact that you cannot perfom an action into the file while it's in use by another program( in this case csv file will open
on excel).
Any questions please contact me..
